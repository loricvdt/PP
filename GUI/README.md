# GUI for the potential barrier

Graphical interface enabling to modify parameters of the wave function passing through a potential barrier in real time. For information on how the calculations are made check [calculations](calculations.pdf)

Created by [Loric Vandentempel](https://github.com/loricvdt/)

## Dependencies

The packages needed to run this code are **tkinter** (may already come with Python) and **matplotlib**

## Usage

Potential barrier and energy parameters are settable by:

- Moving the sliders on the right
- Setting the value in the corresponding text box and pressing enter
- Dragging the lines on the graph to the desired shape

In addition, it is also possible to drag in between the vertical lines of the potential to move the entire barrier sideways
